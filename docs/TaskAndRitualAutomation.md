# Task & Ritual Automation

## 1. Purpose  
Define and automate the recurring “rituals” and routine operational tasks that keep the All-in-One IoT Edge project running smoothly—everything from daily stand-ups to monthly dependency audits. By codifying these as scheduled automations, the team offloads reminder burdens, ensures consistency, and frees up mental bandwidth for high-value work.

---

## 2. Scope  
Covers all project-wide recurring activities, including but not limited to:  
- Agile ceremonies (stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, retrospectives)  
- CI/CD health checks (build status, test coverage, performance benchmarks)  
- Security & dependency audits (vulnerability scans, license updates)  
- Documentation maintenance (docs refresh, grammar/spelling checks)  
- Community engagement (bi-weekly office hours, monthly newsletter)

## 3. Automation Principles  

| Principle                       | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Imperative Titles**           | Use verb-first, concise titles (e.g. “Run Dependency Audit”)                                         |
| **Self-Contained Prompts**      | Prompts start with “Tell me to…” or “Search for…” and describe the action without schedule details   |
| **iCal VEVENT Schedules**       | Define recurrence with `RRULE`; specify `BYHOUR`, `BYMINUTE`, etc.; use `dtstart_offset_json` sparingly |
| **Appropriate Frequency**       | Align schedule to ritual cadence (daily stand-up → weekdays at 9:00; sprint planning → bi-weekly)    |
| **Review & Adapt**              | Regularly (quarterly) review automated tasks for relevance—disable or update as project evolves      |

## 5. Implementation Guidelines  

1. **Creating an Automation**  
 ```jsonc
 // Example: Daily Stand-up
 {
   "title": "Run daily stand-up",
   "prompt": "Tell me to run our daily stand-up meeting with the team.",
   "schedule": "BEGIN:VEVENT\nRRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0;BYSECOND=0\nEND:VEVENT"
 }
````

2. **Managing Tasks**

   * **List** all active automations monthly to ensure relevance.
   * **Disable** any that are no longer needed (e.g. if sprint cadence changes).
   * **Update** schedules promptly when meeting times shift.
3. **Naming & Ownership**

   * Prefix titles with the area if helpful (e.g. “Docs: Review project docs”).
   * Assign an **owner** responsible for verifying the task executes successfully.

---

## 6. Review & Evolution

* **Sprint Retrospective**: Check if ritual automations are firing at the right times and being acted upon.
* **Quarterly Governance Meeting**: Revisit automation catalog; retire or introduce new tasks.
* **Feedback Loop**: Encourage team to request new automations as project processes mature.

---

*By automating and ritualizing our core project activities, we ensure consistency, free up cognitive load, and maintain high operational discipline.*
