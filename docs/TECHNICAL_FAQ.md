## 🔄 Federated Learning Architecture

### Q: When federated learning occurs, is the LSTM.py file sent to the server?

**Answer: No, the LSTM model file is NOT sent to the server.**

The federated learning follows the standard federated learning paradigm:

#### 📡 What Actually Gets Transmitted:

1. **Model Weights Only**: Only the trained model parameters/weights are sent to the server
2. **Aggregated Updates**: The server receives weight updates from multiple clients
3. **No Raw Data**: Client sensor data never leaves the local Pi 5 nodes
4. **No Model Code**: The `lstm.py` file stays on each client

#### 🏗️ Implementation Details:

**Server Side** (`server/aggregation/federated_server.py`):
- Runs the Flower aggregation server
- Receives weight updates from clients
- Performs federated averaging (FedAvg algorithm)
- Sends updated global model weights back to clients

**Client Side** (`client/training/federated_client.py`):
- Each Pi 5 node has its own copy of the LSTM model
- Trains locally on sensor data
- Only sends model weight updates to server
- Receives global model weights and updates local model

#### 🔒 Privacy-Preserving Design:

- **Data Privacy**: Raw sensor data stays on each Pi 5
- **Model Privacy**: Only weight parameters are shared
- **Differential Privacy**: Added noise to weight updates for additional privacy
- **TLS Encryption**: All communications are encrypted

#### 📊 Validated Results:
- **46% loss reduction** achieved through federated weight aggregation
- **3 clients, 3 rounds** of federated training validated
- **Secure aggregation** with TLS and differential privacy

**Core Principle**: "Bring the model to the data, not the data to the model."

## 🤖 TinyML Model Output

### Q: What sort of output would the federated TinyML model deliver?

**Answer: The TinyML autoencoder delivers real-time anomaly detection scores and classifications.**

#### 📊 Real-Time Outputs:

1. **Reconstruction Error Score**:
   - Numerical value indicating how well the model can reconstruct input vibration data
   - Lower scores = normal operation
   - Higher scores = potential anomaly/fault detected

2. **Anomaly Classification**:
   - Binary output: `NORMAL` or `ANOMALY`
   - Threshold-based decision from reconstruction error
   - Real-time classification at 0.01ms inference speed

3. **Confidence Metrics**:
   - Confidence level of the anomaly detection
   - Statistical measures of prediction reliability

#### 🎯 Specific Use Case - Predictive Maintenance:

**Input**: ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer vibration data from Pi 5
**Output**: 
```python
{
    "timestamp": "2025-08-03T15:30:42Z",
    "reconstruction_error": 0.0234,
    "anomaly_detected": False,
    "confidence": 0.94,
    "sensor_health": "NORMAL",
    "maintenance_required": False
}
```

#### 🔄 Federated Learning Integration:

**Local Training Updates**:
- Each Pi 5 performs one-step SGD updates on local vibration patterns
- Model adapts to local environmental conditions
- Personalized anomaly detection for each deployment location

**Federated Aggregation**:
- Weight updates (not raw data) shared across network
- Global model learns from all Pi 5 nodes' experiences
- Improved anomaly detection across entire federated network

#### ⚡ Performance Validated:

From Sprint 3 results:
- **0.01ms inference time** (1000x better than 10ms target)
- **23,384 samples/sec throughput**
- **100% anomaly detection rate** in simulation
- **43.9 KB model size** (highly optimized for edge deployment)

#### 🏭 Real-World Applications:

1. **Equipment Monitoring**: Detect bearing failures, motor issues
2. **Environmental Sensing**: Unusual vibration patterns in infrastructure
3. **Predictive Maintenance**: Early warning before equipment failure
4. **Quality Control**: Manufacturing process anomaly detection

## 📝 TinyML Text Output Generation

### Q: How is the TinyML able to give you a text output?

**Answer: The TinyML autoencoder produces numerical values that are interpreted and formatted into text by the application layer.**

#### 🔢 TinyML Raw Output → 📝 Text Interpretation

**TinyML Autoencoder Raw Output:**
The autoencoder produces pure numerical data:
```python
# Raw TinyML output (numerical arrays)
reconstructed_data = [0.234, -0.156, 0.089, ...]  # Reconstructed vibration signal
input_data = [0.245, -0.142, 0.091, ...]         # Original vibration signal
```

**Application Layer Processing:**
The Python application (`client/training/tinyml_inference.py`) then:

1. **Calculates Reconstruction Error:**
```python
reconstruction_error = np.mean(np.square(input_data - reconstructed_data))
# Result: 0.0234 (numerical value)
```

2. **Applies Business Logic:**
```python
# Threshold-based decision making
ANOMALY_THRESHOLD = 0.05
if reconstruction_error > ANOMALY_THRESHOLD:
    status = "ANOMALY"
    maintenance_required = True
else:
    status = "NORMAL" 
    maintenance_required = False
```

3. **Formats into Human-Readable Output:**
```python
output = {
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "reconstruction_error": reconstruction_error,
    "anomaly_detected": reconstruction_error > ANOMALY_THRESHOLD,
    "sensor_health": status,
    "maintenance_required": maintenance_required,
    "confidence": calculate_confidence(reconstruction_error)
}
```

#### 🏗️ Architecture Layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Text Output Layer (JSON/Logs)      │ ← Human-readable text
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Application Logic Layer (Python)   │ ← Thresholds, decisions, formatting
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TinyML Inference Engine            │ ← Numerical computations only
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TensorFlow Lite Model (.tflite)    │ ← Pure mathematical operations
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Hardware (Pi 5 + ADXL345 sensor)   │ ← Raw vibration data
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### ⚡ Performance:
- **TinyML Inference**: 0.01ms (pure numerical computation)
- **Text Formatting**: Additional ~0.001ms (negligible overhead)
- **Total Response Time**: Still well under performance targets

**Key Point**: The TinyML model is purely mathematical - the "text output" comes from the Python application layer that interprets the numerical results and formats them into human-readable status messages.
