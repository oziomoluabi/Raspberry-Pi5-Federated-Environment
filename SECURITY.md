# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Raspberry Pi 5 Federated Environmental Monitoring Network:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **[INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Considerations

### Federated Learning Security

- **Model Privacy**: We implement differential privacy mechanisms to protect individual node data
- **Secure Aggregation**: Weight updates are aggregated securely without exposing individual contributions
- **Communication Security**: All federated learning communications use TLS encryption
- **Authentication**: Nodes authenticate using certificates or secure tokens

### Edge Device Security

- **Sensor Data**: Sensor readings are processed locally and only aggregated statistics are shared
- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest on edge devices
- **Network Security**: All network communications are encrypted
- **Access Control**: Physical and logical access to devices is controlled

### MATLAB Integration Security

- **Code Execution**: MATLAB scripts are sandboxed and validated before execution
- **Data Validation**: All data passed to MATLAB functions is validated and sanitized
- **Resource Limits**: MATLAB processes have resource limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Common Vulnerabilities

We actively monitor and protect against:

- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, code injection
- **Authentication Bypass**: Weak authentication mechanisms
- **Data Exposure**: Unintended data leakage through logs or APIs
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Unencrypted communications
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access to system resources

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to the repository
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive configuration
- Follow secure coding practices and input validation
- Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities
- Use static analysis tools to identify potential security issues

### For Deployments

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication
- Keep operating systems and software up to date
- Use firewalls and network segmentation
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all web communications

### For Raspberry Pi Deployments

- Change default passwords immediately
- Disable unnecessary services
- Use SSH key authentication instead of passwords
- Keep the OS and packages updated
- Use a firewall (ufw or iptables)
- Monitor system logs regularly

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial response and acknowledgment
3. **Day 3-7**: Vulnerability assessment and reproduction
4. **Day 8-30**: Development of fix and testing
5. **Day 31-45**: Release of security update
6. **Day 46+**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days and will provide regular updates on progress.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2) and will be clearly marked in the release notes. We recommend all users update to the latest version as soon as possible.

### Notification Channels

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Project documentation updates
- Email notifications (for registered users)

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following individuals for their responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities:
